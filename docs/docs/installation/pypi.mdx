# Installing Superset from PyPI

This page describes how to install Superset using the `apache-superset` package [published on PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/apache-superset/).

## OS Dependencies

Superset uses the `cryptography` Python library to encrypt database connection passwords. This library requires the installation of OS-level dependencies.

**Debian and Ubuntu**

The following command will ensure that the required dependencies are installed:

```
sudo apt-get install build-essential libssl-dev libffi-dev python-dev python-pip libsasl2-dev libldap2-dev default-libmysqlclient-dev
```

In Ubuntu 20.04 the following command will ensure that the required dependencies are installed:

```
sudo apt-get install build-essential libssl-dev libffi-dev python3-dev python3-pip libsasl2-dev libldap2-dev default-libmysqlclient-dev
```

**Fedora and RHEL-derivative Linux distributions**

Install the following packages using the `yum` package manager:

```
sudo yum install gcc gcc-c++ libffi-devel python-devel python-pip python-wheel openssl-devel cyrus-sasl-devel openldap-devel
```

In more recent versions of CentOS and Fedora, you may need to install a slightly different set of packages using `dnf`:

```
sudo dnf install gcc gcc-c++ libffi-devel python3-devel python3-pip python3-wheel openssl-devel cyrus-sasl-devel openldap-devel
```

Also, on CentOS, you may need to upgrade pip for the install to work:

```
pip3 install --upgrade pip
```

**Mac OS X**

If you're not on the latest version of OS X, we recommend upgrading because we've found that many
issues people have run into are linked to older versions of Mac OS X. After updating, install the
latest version of XCode command line tools:

```
xcode-select --install
```

We don't recommend using the system installed Python. Instead, first install the
[homebrew](https://brew.sh/) manager and then run the following commands:

```
brew install readline pkg-config libffi openssl mysql postgresql@14
```

You should install a recent version of Python. Refer to the
[pyproject.toml](https://github.com/apache/superset/blob/master/pyproject.toml) file for a list of Python
versions officially supported by Superset. We'd recommend using a Python version manager
like [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv)
(and also [pyenv-virtualenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv-virtualenv)).

:::tip
To identify the Python version used by the official docker image, see the [Dockerfile](https://github.com/apache/superset/blob/master/Dockerfile). Additional docker images published for newer versions of Python can be found in [this file](https://github.com/apache/superset/blob/master/scripts/build_docker.py).
:::

Let's also make sure we have the latest version of `pip` and `setuptools`:

```
pip install --upgrade setuptools pip
```

Lastly, you may need to set LDFLAGS and CFLAGS for certain Python packages to properly build. You can export these variables with:

```
export LDFLAGS="-L$(brew --prefix openssl)/lib"
export CFLAGS="-I$(brew --prefix openssl)/include"
```

These will now be available when pip installing requirements.

## Python Virtual Environment

We highly recommend installing Superset inside of a virtual environment. Python ships with
`virtualenv` out of the box. If you're using [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv), you can install [pyenv-virtualenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv-virtualenv). Or you can install it with `pip`:

```
pip install virtualenv
```

First create a directory for Superset:
```
mkdir superset
```

Then create and activate a virtual environment there:
```
python3 -m venv superset
. superset/bin/activate
```

While your virtual environment is activated, all of the Python packages you install or uninstall
will be confined to this environment. You can exit the environment by running `deactivate` on the
command line.

### Installing and Initializing Superset

First, start by installing `apache-superset`:

```
pip install apache-superset
```

Superset configurations are stored in a file.  One of these configurations, a `SECRET_KEY`, is required for the application to start. Create your config file:
```
touch superset/superset_config.py
```
And make this file findable by adding its path as an environment variable:
```
export SUPERSET_CONFIG_PATH=superset/superset_config.py
```
Note that this stores the path in the environment only temporarily.  If you wish for this to persist through reboots, permanently set this environment variable by [adding it to your `~/.profile` file](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/117467/how-to-permanently-set-environmental-variables).

Now generate a strong value for `SECRET_KEY` and write it to your config file:
```
echo "SECRET_KEY='$(openssl rand -base64 42)'" | tee -a superset/superset_config.py
```
Do not lose this key. Consider maintaining a secure backup of your `superset_config.py` file.

You could also tell Superset where to store its metadata - that is, what charts, dashboards, etc. have been created.  By default, this is a SQLite database at the filepath `~/.superset/superset.db`.

In a production setup, you would change this to point to say, a PostgreSQL database that gets backed up.  You change this by specifying a new value in `superset_config.py` for the variable `SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI`.

Set an environment variable so that `superset` commands will work in the terminal. As above, this is temporary, and can be set to persist by adding it to your `~/.profile`.
```
export FLASK_APP=superset
```

Now initialize the database:
```
superset db upgrade
```

Finish installing by running through the following commands:
```
# Create an admin user in your metadata database (use `admin` as username to be able to load the examples)
superset fab create-admin

# Load some data to play with
superset load_examples

# Create default roles and permissions
superset init

# To start a development web server on port 8088, use -p to bind to another port
superset run -p 8088 --with-threads --reload --debugger
```

If everything worked, you should be able to navigate to `hostname:port` in your browser (e.g.
locally by default at `localhost:8088`) and login using the username and password you created.

Next see [Configuring Superset](/docs/configuration/configuring-superset) and further set up your instance.
